You are an expert computational biologist and machine learning researcher.

Context:
- Refer to the Vandijklab C2S-Scale Gemma model (Hugging Face: vandijklab/C2S-Scale-Gemma-2-27B) and the associated preprint.
- I want safe, high-level, computational suggestions for experiments and ways to interact with the model by conversation. Do NOT provide wet-lab protocols, step-by-step biological procedures, or anything that could enable biological harm.

Tasks:
1) Give a concise summary of the model and the preprint's main claims (1-3 short paragraphs).
2) Propose a set of in-silico experiments I can run to evaluate the model for therapeutic discovery support (focus on dataset selection, evaluation metrics, and reproducibility).
3) Suggest conversation-driven experiments (examples of prompts / dialog flows) I can use when "talking to the model" to assess usefulness for hypothesis generation, literature synthesis, or experimental design *at a high level*.
4) List safe limitations and ethical considerations to keep in mind when using the model for biomedical research.

Deliver the response as:
- Short summary
- Bullet list of proposed in-silico experiments (each with objective, inputs, outputs, and metric)
- Example conversational prompts (3-6) for interactive experiments
- Short notes on limitations and ethics

Reminder: Keep recommendations high-level and non-actionable for wet-lab work.
