# Code of Conduct

Purpose
- Maintain a respectful, inclusive, and professional environment for contributors, reviewers, and users of the C2S-Scale Medical Research Lab repository.

Expected behavior
- Be respectful, constructive, and professional in issues, pull requests, commits, and other communications.
- Report problems politely and provide reproducible information where possible.
- Respect privacy and do not post personal or protected health information (PHI) in public issues or outputs.

Unacceptable behavior
- Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, intimidation, or personal attacks.
- Posting PHI or other sensitive personal data.
- Repeatedly ignoring reviewer feedback or attempting to bypass review procedures.

Reporting and enforcement
- To report a violation, open a private issue (if the platform supports it) or email the maintainers listed in AUTHORS or README with the subject "CODE_OF_CONDUCT report".
- Maintainers will review reports confidentially and may take actions including warnings, requested changes, temporary or permanent blocking from the repository, and removal of offending content.
- If the report concerns legal or safety issues (e.g., accidental PHI exposure), indicate this clearly in the report so maintainers can prioritize response.

Scope
- This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces: repository issues, pull requests, project boards, CI annotations, and associated community channels.

Contact
- See AUTHORS or README for maintainer contact details used for handling reports and enforcement.

Acknowledgements
- This project aims for safe, ethical, and reproducible biomedical research practices. Contributors should follow institutional and legal requirements in addition to this policy.
